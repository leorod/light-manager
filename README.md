# Light Manager
IoT lights controller project for D1 Mini (ESP8266).
Based on Arduino framework and tzapu's [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager).

Through this, the D1 Mini receives toggle instructions via MQTT and sends signals to a relay in order to switch lights on and off in a room.
